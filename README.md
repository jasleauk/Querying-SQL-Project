# AdventureWorks SQL Queries for Business Insights

This project contains a series of SQL queries designed for business insights and product management using the AdventureWorks database. The queries cover a variety of tasks ranging from basic filtering and analysis to more advanced queries involving data aggregation, transformation, and joining of multiple tables. The goal is to derive actionable business insights and offer practical solutions to real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

The SQL queries in this repository showcase several practical applications of SQL, including:

- **Product Management**: Filtering products based on price, color, and other attributes, and segmenting products using pricing policies.
- **Employee Analysis**: Calculating employee data such as age at hiring, retirement dates, and eligibility for long service awards.
- **Sales and Customer Insights**: Joining tables to understand sales patterns, customer demographics, and sales commissions.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Utilising views, common table expressions (CTEs), and advanced SQL functions to address complex business questions.

These queries demonstrate a deep understanding of relational database systems and provide actionable business insights. Whether youâ€™re a data analyst, business intelligence professional, or developer, these queries will help you understand how to transform raw data into meaningful analysis.

## Key Features & Techniques

### 1. **String Functions**  
   String functions like `LEFT()` and `CONCAT()` are used to manipulate and extract substrings from string fields, such as matching prefixes of names with email addresses or creating full names from first and last names.

### 2. **Date Functions**  
   Functions such as `LEN()`, `DATEDIFF()`, and `DATEADD()` are employed to calculate lengths, time intervals, and future dates, allowing for the calculation of key insights like employee age at hire or years until retirement.

### 3. **Conditional Logic with CASE Statements**  
   Advanced `CASE` statements are used extensively to create dynamic classifications based on specific attributes. These include segments for product prices, adjusted costs, and commissions based on colour or other factors.

### 4. **Data Aggregation**  
   Aggregate functions such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()` are used to summarize and group data. These functions help derive insights like the number of employees eligible for long service awards or the average manufacturing days for product subcategories.

### 5. **JOINS for Data Integration**  
   Multiple `JOIN` operations (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) combine data from various tables, such as product details, sales figures, employee records, and customer demographics. This allows for a holistic view of business operations.

### 6. **Ranking and Window Functions**  
   Window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` and `DENSE_RANK()` are used for ranking and ordering data. These techniques are ideal for tasks like finding the top products by colour or ranking employees based on service length.

### 7. **Views and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
   The use of views and CTEs simplifies complex queries, making them more modular and reusable. For example, a view to get the top 5 products per colour, or a CTE to rank products based on price, can be reused throughout the business logic.

### 8. **Efficient Data Aggregation**  
   By using powerful aggregate functions and window functions, complex data analysis tasks are simplified, enabling quicker decision-making.

### 9. **Dynamic and Flexible Queries**  
   With advanced use of `CASE` statements and conditional logic, these queries can adapt to varying business requirements and changing data.

### 10. **Modular and Reusable Code**  
   The use of views and CTEs ensures that the SQL queries remain clean, readable, and reusable across different business operations.

### 11. **Comprehensive Data Integration**  
   With a combination of `JOIN` operations, we effectively integrate data from multiple tables, providing a more comprehensive view of business operations.
